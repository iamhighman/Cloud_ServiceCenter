# Cloud_ServiceCenter

A MVC web framework written by PHP

We proposed a 4-layer service platform and related operation mechanism that incorporates Google Cloud Computing environment and Service Oriented Architecture in a sense to provide new paradigm of system development. Service Combination Mechanism connects service consumer, service provider and service menu. Resource Allocation Mechanism provides loading balance, parallel processing and fault-tolerant features. Data Control Mechanism only authorizes the necessary part of data to avoid the risk of information security. Management Mechanism implements AAA protocol.

Service Interface Layer utilizes the advantage of open platform and reduces the burden of interface development. Control Center Layer connect service providers and service requesters, while handling service flow and using the resource of external cloud computing and data center. Service Provider Layer reserves the management authority and ownership of the data resources. Infrastructure Layer assemble service framework, computing ability and storage resource that are provided by Cloud Computing providers.
